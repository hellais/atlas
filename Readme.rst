Atlas
=====

Atlas is a web application to discover Tor relays. It provides useful
information on how relays are configured along with diagrams about their past.


Running it
----------

Some browsers might allow you to directly open the index.html file in the
repository's root directory. If that does not work, you have to use a web
server to run atlas.
